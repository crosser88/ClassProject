				I recently got back into learning music theory again. After getting past your commonly
				heard major chords, it's time to spice it up. <br>Major chords are made up of triads,
				scale formula (<b>Root</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>5</b>), the degrees of the major scale 
				(e.g. A maj: <b>A</b>, B, <b>C#</b>, D, <b>E</b>, F#, G#)<br>
				As the name of the chord suggests, this is simply adding the 7th degree of the major
				scale to the chord (Root(A), 3(C#), 5(E), 7(G#)).<br> With the guitar in standard tuning,
				the open A string, middle finger on the 2nd fret of the D string, index finger on the 1st
				fret <br>of the G string, ring finger on the 2nd fret of the B string, and the open high E string
				will give you a A maj7 chord.<br>The chord can be played else where on the neck but may require different
				finger positioning.<br>Congratulations, you've learned how to play an A major seventh chord.
				<br><br>
				Below is a video on Major Seventh Chords.

				I've added a snippet from the song writing/tablature software, Guitar Pro 7. The example
				shows three different A chords. <br>The first one is your typical A major chord, then the
				A maj7 chord, and lastly the A minor chord. To read the tablature, it's <br> like looking
				down at the guitar neck. The bottom line represents the 6th string or Low E (thickest string).
				The numbers <br> represent the fret number on the neck. I find this the easiest to start
				learning how to play guitar. I do recommend to <br> start reading music notation if you want to
				be more serious about music.
