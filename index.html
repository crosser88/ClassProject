				Hey! My name is Christopher, and I've been playing guitar for 20 years. I played in local bands for 
				a couple of years until I was hired on to play bass for the band, <br>A Hero A Fake (<a href="https://victoryrecords.com/artist/a-hero-a-fake/" class="aheroafake" target="_blank">Victory Records</a>). 
				This gave me insight on the process of recording an album. I got to work with well known names in the industry such as, Joey Sturgis, Cameron Mizell, and Jamie King. 
				<br>I've been engineering, producing, mixing, and mastering audio since <strong>2009</strong>. I continually strive honing my craft in the ever evolving technology 
				of music while focusing on creating a sound that is organic and authentic to the artistry of each client. 
				Whether an aspiring amateur or a seasoned pro, my goal is to provide an exceptional audio service at a price 
				that is compatible with your budget.
				<br>
				<br>
				<p class="subpara">
					I can provide a professional sound in genres including: Metal, Rock, Indie, Country, Rap, Hip Hop, EDM, and more
					<br>
