			The title for the default page is, Index. I plan to build upon my webpage by learning the necessary
			tags to implement <b>structure</b> and <b>functionality</b> of the web page.<br> I will apply the three major
			considerations to be appropriately displayed among all devices and easily navigational for the users.
			As I learn the supportive web <br> services (e.g. CSS), I'll further be able to modify the aesthetics of
		    the web page.
