				A quick summary of my, Christopher Rosser, music career/hobby. I've been playing guitar for
				16 years. I played in local bands for a couple of years until I was hired on to play bass for
				the band, <a href="https://victoryrecords.com/artist/a-hero-a-fake/" class="aheroafake" target="_blank">A Hero A Fake</a>.
				A dream come true to be on the same record label, <a href="https://victoryrecords.com/" class="victory" target="_blank">
				Victory Records</a>, as many bands and artists I listened to in my young adult years.
				This gave me insight on the process of recording an album, shooting a music video, and touring.
				I got to work with <a href="https://www.jamiekingaudio.com/?fbclid=IwAR2FxrB78qjoUW3VYI_JWmSY5307XHL5ot3ibV5rlgQx19W0aXzhM5a5bS8"
				class="jamie" target="_blank">Jamie King</a> who recorded/mixed for bands: Between the Buried and Me, Alesana, Close Your Eyes,
				He Is Legend, A Skylit Drive, For Today, and many others. <br><br>Well known names in the music industry, Joey Sturgis and
				Cameron Mizell, mixed and mastered our album. After the blissful experience writing/recording the album, we went up
				to Chicago to shoot our music video. It was interesting how they shot and pieced together the video. We stopped by
				the Victory HQs to do play through videos of two of our songs. Finally, we embarked on several tours in support of our
				album, The Future Again.
				<br><br>
				I left the band in 2013, to help family and continue my education. I'm a senior about to finish my B.S. in <em>
				Computer Programming Technology</em>. In the past couple of years, I picked the guitar back up and started acquiring
				music equipment again. I decided to revive the dream of having my own studio and start recording, mixing, and mastering
				for my own projects and future clients.
